Exploring the potential of the Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) data model.

Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) is a logical data model that is often utilized when the possible number of data items
that can be collected are many but the actual number collected in any given project are few.

An overview of EAV can be found here:

Typically the biggest criticism of EAV is that it is hard to get data out due to the non-normalized structure of the data.

This project is an exploration of techniques that can address the various perceived shortcomings of the EAV model.
